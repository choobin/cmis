	* bootstrap.js
	* item.[js|xul]
	* edit.[js|xul]
	Included option to add a default 'Save As...' menu item to
	anywhere in the CMIS context menu.

2013-01-05  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* Cmis.io.save Updated addDownload and saveURL functions to deal
	with FF18's per-window private browsing context.

2013-01-03  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* Cmis.util.filename Fixed issue where
	nsIMIMEService.getPrimaryExtension("image/jpg", null) running XP
	x86_64 was returning a different value to FF builds on Linux and
	later versions of Windows.

2012-12-29  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* Cmis.util.filename
	- As of FF18 there is no longer a single image cache. Cmis checks
	  the browsers version string and deals with this correctly.
	- @mozilla.org/initl/texttosuburi;1 was not using the correct URI.
	- Added a check to determine if the source URI looks like a directory.

	* Cmis.util.validate Checks for a correct file suffix. If it is
	missing it will append one acording to its Content-Type HTTP
	header.

	* bootstrap.js Prepending file name prefix was indexing the wrong
	element fromm directory_data

2012-11-29  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.js nsIWebBrowserPersist.saveURI takes a seventh
	argument which was neglected. This was causing a hang-up on FF18b2
	and preventing it from saving anything.

2012-08-28  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.js
	* edit.js
	Replaced all calls to FileUtils.jsm with a call to
	Cc[@mozilla.org/file/local;1].createInstance(Ci.nsILocalFile).
	Pre Gecko 9.0 does not support FileUtils.File.

	* bootstrap.js (startup/shutdown) Post Gecko 10.0 manifest
	registration is performed automatically. Added code to startup and
	shutdown functions for manifest registration if the addon is
	running on older versions.

	* items.xul Set treelines="true" on the tree XUL element. This
	shows lines bellow hierarchical item elements and make things much
	easier on the eyes.

	* install.rdf Updated minVersion to 8.0. Previous versions does
	not handle manifest registration correctly.

2012-08-27  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.js Updated Cmis.menu.inject and Cmis.prefs functions
	to deal with submenus.

	* items.js Added load, save, move and delete functionality for
	submenus. Updated items.select() to deal with submenus.

	* items.xul Added new submenu button. Treeview now adjusts size
	when window is adjusted instead of being stuck at 12 items.

2012-08-24  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.prefs) Fixed issue where preference branch
	was being deleted on application upgrade. Now it will only delete
	the branch when the uninstall function reason argument is
	ADDON_INSTALL.

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.prefs) directoryList was changed from a basic
	char preference type to a complex Ci.nsISupportsString type so we
	can support unicode directories and menu labels.

2012-08-22  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.io) Replaced call to Services.downloads with
	Cc[nsIdownloadManager]...  Services.jsm states that it was
	introduced in Firefox 4.0. I assumed that Services.downloads was
	also included at that point; since nsIDownloadManager was
	introduced in Firefox 3.5. However, on older versions of Firefox
	(tested with v10 and v13) died on error.

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.util) Added an extra step in util.filename
	that cleans up the source URL string removing HTTP GET parameters
	beofre extracting a filename.

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.util) Added a filename validation function
	which is relatively similar to the validateFileName function found
	in contentAreaUtils.js. It replaces characters that do not belong
	in filenames with valid characters.

2012-08-16  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.io) Abstracted file name creation code to
	Cmis.util.filename.

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.util) New function filename will first check
	for a Content-Disposition HTTP header with a 'filename' parameter
	before extracting the name from the URL string.

2012-08-01  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.io) Using nsIWebBrowserPersist.saveURI instead
	of the internalSave function from .../global/contentAreaUtils.js.

	* bootstrap.js (Cmis.utility) Using Services.prompt.confirmEx instead
	of a custom xul file and a window.openDialog call.

2012-07-20  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* Cmis Project is now a bootstrapped (no restart) add on.

	* options.xul Preference dialog moved to the add-on manager screen.

	* options.xul New preference added, "Save links (not just images)".

	* Update Minimum version requirement changed to 7.0.

	* Update Version string changed to a more appropriate format.

2011-10-27  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* options.xul Replaced confirmOverwrite checkbox with
	overwriteAction menu selection.

	* overlay.js (saveImage) Updated function to deal with three save
	options. Prompt user, save and overwrite file, and save to a
	unique file.

	* overlay.xul Removed string-bundle from overlay. No longer needed.

	* overlay.js (confirmOverwrite) Renamed to promptOverwrite. No
	longer using confirmEx dialog option. I use a custom dialog to
	keep option buttons relatively consistent across operating
	systems. See bug 345067.

	* cmis.dtd Added new ENTITY elements for new prompt.xul dialog.

	* prompt.js
	* prompt.xul
	* prompt.properties
	* prompt.css

	New files to deal with prompt dialog to deal with overwriting scenario.

	* install.rdf Updated em:version.

2011-08-28  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* editietm.js (onPickFolder) Updates menu item label on every
	folder change (issue #1).

	* overlay.js (showContextMenu) gContextMenu.imageURL does not need to
	be an argument to the closure as it never changes.

	* install.rdf Update em:version for submission to AMO

	* install.rdf em:iconURL image renamed to icon.png

2011-08-25  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* overlay.js (showContextMenu) Using addEventListener in place of
	setAtttribute to add oncommand callback.

	* overlay.js (saveImage) Added code to confirm from user before
	saveImage is about to overwrite a file.

	* overlay.js (getUniqueFilename) Replaced getUniqueFilename with
	uniqueFile function found in firefox/omni/.../contentAreaUtils.js

	* overlay.xul Added stringbundleset for use in confirm prompt code
	in overlay.js.

	* options.xul Added option to toggle user prompt that deals with
	saveImage overwriting files.

	* pref.js Added confirmOverwite default preference set to bool:true

	* about.xul Removed about dialog. It is too hard to naivigate
	to. Everything on there can be found on the AMO page.

2011-08-07  Christopher Hoobin  <hsirhc@gmail.com>

	* overlay.js (onQuickSave) Fixed event propagation issue during
	quick save.
